1. array : collection of elements in contigious memory locations.
   Elements are accessed by index. Each element has a maximum of 2 neighbours except first and last
   Arrays are building blocks of stacks and queue
   differnce between stacks and linked list is that in array -> element can be accessed by index but in linked list we have to traverse entire array to access the element
   Accessing element outside the array will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
   One disadvantage of array is we have to define size during the time of instantiation
   In arrays, all elements should be of same dataType
   In 2D arrays, we have to define rows and columns at the time of initialization
   `int[][] myArray = new int[10][] ;` This will throw NullPointerException
